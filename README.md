# üëã Hi, I'm Abdullah Shaikh  

I design and build high-performance systems, developer tools, and AI applications. My work spans from real-time analytics engines and Rust-based databases to mathematical research pipelines and AI-powered browser extensions used by 100+ people. I focus on creating software that is both technically rigorous and impactful, combining strong systems engineering with applied research and mathematics.
