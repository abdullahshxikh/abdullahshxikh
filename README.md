# üëã Hi, I'm Abdullah Shaikh
Welcome to my GitHub! I‚Äôm a student at St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School passionate about artificial intelligence, automation, and developer tools. My focus is on building projects that combine technical depth with practical impact, from AI-powered productivity extensions to real-time automation systems.

I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and think critically about design, performance, and usability. My goal is to create tools that not only solve problems but also deliver polished user experiences and push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with AI-driven software.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
### üî¢ PrimeScape
A research platform that transforms prime number sequences into graph networks and applies spectral graph theory to uncover hidden mathematical structures. PrimeScape automates the full research pipeline from generating prime-based graphs, running parameter sweeps, and computing eigenvalue spectra, to logging metrics and producing publication-ready visualizations and markdown reports.

**Key Features**  
- Graph Models: Prime gaps, residue classes, and random baselines  
- Spectral Analysis: Adjacency/Laplacian eigenvalues, entropy, spectral radius, algebraic connectivity (Œª‚ÇÇ), spectral gap  
- Experiment Automation: YAML configs, reproducible random seeds, master results logging  
- Reporting: Auto-generated plots, trend analysis, and research question inference  
- Scalability: Efficient runs up to 100K+ primes with batch processing  

**Tech**: Python, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Pandas, Matplotlib
