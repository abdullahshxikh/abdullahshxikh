👋 Hi, I'm Abdullah Shaikh
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a student at St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School passionate about artificial intelligence, automation, and developer tools. My focus is on building projects that combine technical depth with practical impact, from AI-powered productivity extensions to real-time automation systems.

I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and think critically about design, performance, and usability. My goal is to create tools that not only solve problems but also deliver polished user experiences and push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI-driven software.

🛠️ Projects

✍️ PastePilot

An invisible AI writing assistant that integrates directly into your browser. With a simple Alt + Shift + T shortcut, it instantly generates context-aware text, helping users draft, rephrase, or ideate without breaking their workflow. Designed to feel seamless, not intrusive.
Tech: JavaScript, React.js, Chrome Extension API, OpenAI API

👁️ Unveil

A Chrome extension that lets users bypass restricted content previews, unlocking hidden text on web pages. Built with a focus on stealth, usability, and polished UI, Unveil provides fast, one-click access to information while maintaining a clean experience.
Tech: JavaScript, Chrome Extension API, DOM manipulation

📄 Google Forms Solver

A smart extension that helps students automatically fill out restricted or “locked” Google Forms. It bypasses common limitations and enhances usability, showcasing problem-solving and technical creativity.
Tech: JavaScript, Chrome Extension API, content scripts

🐦 TabTweet

A lightweight, fast Twitter/X client built as a Chrome extension. It allows users to draft and post tweets directly from a browser tab without needing to open X.com, reducing distractions and streamlining communication.
Tech: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Chrome Extension API

📈 What I’m Working On

Building AI-powered productivity extensions that integrate seamlessly into daily workflows


Exploring how automation + UX design can reduce friction in online learning and communication


Expanding into backend integrations (APIs, authentication, server automation)


Developing a Physics-Inspired Simulation Toolkit — using computational algorithms to model real-world physics (motion, orbits, waves) and make abstract concepts more accessible through interactive modeling
